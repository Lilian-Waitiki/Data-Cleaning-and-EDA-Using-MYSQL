This project contains the layoffs in different countries. It consists of the data cleaning process I used in MySQL.
<br>Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022 

The data contained in this dataset pertains to various companies and their layoff statistics. The dataset includes the following columns:

<br>`company`: The name of the company.
<br>`location`: The location of the company.
industry: The industry to which the company belongs.
total_laid_off: The total number of employees laid off.
percentage_laid_off: The percentage of the workforce that was laid off.
date: The date when the layoffs were announced.
stage: The stage of the company (e.g., startup, established).
country: The country where the company is located.
funds_raised_millions: The amount of funds raised by the company in millions.

This dataset will be analyzed to understand the patterns and trends in layoffs across different companies, industries, and locations. The analysis will involve cleaning the data by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, handling null or blank values, and removing any unnecessary columns or rows.
