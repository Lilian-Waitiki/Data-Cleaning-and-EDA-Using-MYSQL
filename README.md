# Data-Cleaning-and-EDA-Using-MYSQL
This project contains the layoffs in different countries. It consists of the data cleaning process I used in MySQL.
<br>Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022 

The data contained in this dataset pertains to various companies and their layoff statistics. The dataset includes the following columns:
<br>`company`: The name of the company.
<br>`location`: The location of the company.
<br>`industry`: The industry to which the company belongs.
<br>`total_laid_off`: The total number of employees laid off.
<br>`percentage_laid_off`: The percentage of the workforce that was laid off.
<br>`date`: The date when the layoffs were announced.
<br>`stage`: The stage of the company (e.g., startup, established).
<br>`country`: The country where the company is located.
<br>`funds_raised_millions`: The amount of funds raised by the company in millions.

<br>The analysis will involve cleaning the data by removing duplicates, standardizing the data, handling null or blank values, and removing any unnecessary columns or rows.
<br>I will also perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the patterns and trends in layoffs across different companies, industries, and locations.
